## Overview

This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** to solve a binary classification problem of malaria cell images into Parasitized and Uninfected.

The workflow included:  
  
- Importing and organizing datasets from Google Drive  
- Preprocessing images (resizing, normalization)  
- Designing and training a CNN model  
- Comparing models with and without DWT-based feature extraction
- Evaluating accuracy and visualizing predictions  


## Business Problem

Malaria diagnosis using microscopes is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this process with AI helps in:

- Reducing human error in early detection
- Speeding up diagnosis in healthcare centers
- Assisting doctors with reliable decision support 

**Objective:** Develop a robust CNN model capable of accurately detecting malaria-infected cells. 


## Dataset

- Malaria Cell Images Dataset (from NIH / Kaggle)

- ~27,500 labeled cell images

- Two categories: Parasitized and Uninfected

- Format: JPEG images with varied resolutions

**Directory Structure:**

/Malaria-Cell-Images

â”œâ”€â”€ Parasitized/

â”œâ”€â”€ Uninfected/

## ðŸ”‘ Insights

- CNN models with DWT preprocessing generally achieved higher accuracy & MCC, showing DWT helps in extracting key frequency features.

- The best performance was achieved with DWT + lr=0.0005 + (16,32,64) filters â†’ Accuracy: 96.61%, MCC: 0.9323.

- Models without DWT also performed strongly, but slightly less consistent across variations.

## Final Recommendations

- Use DWT preprocessing for feature extraction to improve CNN robustness.
- Explore Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet) for further accuracy improvement.
- Deploy the best-performing model as a diagnostic aid for healthcare professionals.
- Extend project to multi-class classification (detecting multiple diseases from blood smear images).
